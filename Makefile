# This is how the documentation says to build a static binary:
# 	swift build --configuration release --static-swift-stdlib
# It doesn’t work. Xcode release notes say:
# 	Creating static executables using the new option --static-swift-stdlib does not function correctly. (33861492)
# so we’ll use their workaround:
	swift build --configuration release  -Xswiftc -static-stdlib
